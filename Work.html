							<p><b><i>Interview with Shane Kennedy - Digital marketer and part time Web Development</b></i></p>
							<p><b>Could you please briefly explain what your tasks are at work?:</b>

In my marketing role, my main tasks are digital marketing focussed. So trying to generate business leads for our sales team. With that, a lot of outbound marketing strategies around our website, we send out a lot of bulk emails. We’ll run Google, Facebook and Linkedin ads. 
A lot of content creation like blogs, white papers, ebooks, videos. Our business is B to B, so we sell our products to services like Apple, Shell, Coca-Cola, they’re some of our biggest clients. Overall in a nutshell my role is general marketing, branding, and then on the side I do web design for small businesses
</p>
							<p><b>For your role in your business do you oversee an entire team or are you one of the team members generating content, graphic design, and whatnot.</b>

Yeah so there’s myself, my manager, and then we have another marketer in our team. So we’re a team of three essentially. The wider business has about forty people around the globe, probably about ten sales people. Maybe about ten in the development space. Then another five or six in operations and accounting and management and the like.
</p>
							<p><b>And what kind of tools would you be using on a daily basis?</b>


A lot of web based tools like Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Linkedin, Campaign Manager, to do our ads. Also Adobe Suite for recreation, so PhotoShop, Illustrator. We’ve recently invested in a platform called Sixth Sense which is like a smart data analytical tool. We also use sales force, SEN Rush, yeah a lot of general marketing tools. Basically a lot of tools that allow us to run ads and allow us to track customers' locations in the lead funnel.
</p>
							<p><b>So how did you first start looking into this role? Was it something you always wanted to do or something you’d just fallen into?</b>

I’ve always been interested in marketing. I started in the fitness industry. That marketing role just developed into digital marketing. More so that’s where the world is going, everyones on social media all the time, people are looking online, not at billboards.
</p>
							<p><b>What do you find most challenging in your line of work?</b>

The different stakeholders in business nowadays. Particularly in marketing, everyone thinks they’re a gun marketer. So I guess the most challenging thing in a business like I’m currently in is working in a team of about forty, and trying to manage everyone’s expectations and trying to please everyone. We have to run campaigns that get results for our sales team, but then have to do it in budget for our accounting team. So a lot of facets you got to juggle.
</p>
							<p><b>What kind of expectations are placed on you on a daily basis?</b>

The main one would be sales. As a marketing team we are expected to deliver a certain number of leads per region for the sales team. So to do that we have to run ads and generate that interest from the market. So the type of pressure put on us from the sales team is just around lead generation, and then there’s all the other operational and accounting requirements. We’ve got to do our reporting to the management team.
</p>
							<p><b>Do you spend more time in an office? Or do you spend more time out talking to clients?</b>

In a non-covid world, we’d be in an office full time. We do sometimes have meetings with external agencies if we need help with our website or if we are running an event. But 95% of the time we’d be in an office.
</p>
							<p><b>If you were to explain your role to someone who has no idea, what would be the simplest way?</b>

I’d say that my role is to make people interested in what our sales team has to sell. I’m trying to create buzz around our product and try to get people to submit some interest in what we are trying to sell. And if people were currently in the market in the decision making process, whether to go with our product or a competitor, it’s my role to build the brand in such a way so that our brand is more familiar, we put more information in peoples hands, to help them make the decision to choose our software.
</p>
							<p><b>At what age did you first get involved in marketing and the digital space</b>

Straight out of uni. So about 21. I went straight from high school to uni to my career. Which was pretty lucky. But about 21 or 22 was when I started to venture more into digital marketing.
I did a business degree, majoring in marketing. So the decision to pursue marketing was made around 18.</p>
							<p><b>So how did you end up picking up all your IT skills?</b>

On the job mostly. So mostly in my marketing role my tasks were to update the website of our brand to work my way through our campaign platforms like Linkedin and Google Ads. There were a few online learning modules through Google Digital Garage which is where they offer free courses. YouTube as well you could say that. Yeah just go to that if I need a few tips here and there. But yeah just on the job and on the fly is where I learnt most of the IT side of things. Particularly when it comes to say photoshop if I don’t know how to do something, just quickly load up an article or YouTube video.
</p>
							<p><b>How difficult was it to transition from the fitness industry into the software industry?</b>

It was pretty difficult because most jobs nowadays like to hire within their industry. And of course you have to have experience to get experience. My experience in fitness would be a weakness when it comes to the interview recruitment process. But the digital marketing skills are pretty universal. So Google ads and running ad campaigns are pretty transferable. So that’s what I tried to highlight when going through the recruitment process. So yeah it wasn’t easy to jump from industry to industry, but I was lucky I guess.
</p>
							<p><b>So how many attempts did it take you to get where you are now? How many interviews and years of experience? How long would you say it took you to transition fully?</b>

Probably around four or five months of going through interviews and sending out resumes and cover letters and stuff. But yeah, it wasn't easy. Particularly with Covid. But who knows what the job market was like. If there’s lots of candidates or it’s pretty dry. I’ve heard a range of things but yeah it’s never easy.
</p>
							<p><b>What would you say would be the best way to get recognised and get their foot in the door in your industry?</b>

I received a bit of advice from a recruiting agency that said on your resume and when you’re talking to potential employers try to give as much tangible evidence of your skills as possible, whether that be through a portfolio, or if you can think of any stats or key achievements you’ve done in your career. Try and include those in your cover letter and your resume and in any of your conversations if you can. For example when I jumped industries one of the things I mentioned was how many leads we generated throughout the covid period and how we are able to run this campaign to achieve certain goals and certain sales in the pipeline. So I was able to give tangible data, so the recruiter was able to go “Wow, this person has been part of good teams and been a key player at getting the job done”.
</p>
							<p><b>Tell us about your side project, web design.</b>

Yeah going well. More recently it has been slow because Victorian businesses aren’t really wanting to get new websites and stuff. But it started towards the end of 2019, I just found that my job having the responsibility of the website was something that I enjoyed. I know that I have a lot of tradie friends that do cashies, so I thought why can’t I do that. So I reached out to a few friends that ran small businesses and asked if they ever considered getting a website up. And starting a business was easier than everyone made it out to be. All you gotta do is really make an Instagram, get a website up, and then you have your own freelance business.
</p>
							<p><b>What made you want to get into web development as a side hobby?</b>

I just picked it up in my role, and I think I am a pretty creative person. All my mates are tradies and they can build something or they can put something together or Shaun can put plaster on a wall and say ‘look at what I’ve done, I’ve done this’. And I sorta thought, ‘What can I do?’. I thought I like the digital space, so I thought I might have a go at building some websites. So it was just passion and curiosity that got me into it.
